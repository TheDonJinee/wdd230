            "history": "The Dallas Texas Temple was the first temple built in Texas. The Dallas Texas Temple is a sister building to the Boise Idaho Temple and the Chicago Illinois Temple. The invitation-only groundbreaking ceremony for the Dallas Texas Temple was attended by about 90 guests including Regional Representatives, stake presidents, and their wives. During the 20-day public open house of the Dallas Texas Temple, approximately 88,000 visitors toured the interior of the building. At the dedication of the Dallas Texas Temple, President Gordon B. Hinckley noted that there were many larger and more expensive buildings in Texas but that the temple was the most significant of all in the Lone Star State. The Dallas Texas Temple closed in 1987 for remodeling that added an additional 22,749 square feet, accommodating an additional ordinance room, a cafeteria, expanded laundry facilities, and a larger relocated baptistry. A renovation of the Dallas Texas Temple grounds was completed in June 2006. The monument sign was relocated outside the decorative fence, and fence itself was altered along the front side of the property. The entry plaza was enlarged, and stairs were added to create better access to the grounds. The water feature was replaced with a cascading fountain while flower beds were made larger and replanted. Several walkways were widened with added lighting and sitting areas.",
