                    <p>Water transportation is still vital to commerce. Early canals connecting freshwater bodies of water 
                        enabled agricultural activities. All of this comes down to one simple fact: water is vital yet relatively
                        inexpensive so many of us take it for granted. That one glass of water gives you life. That plumbing in 
                        your house keeps you healthy. That reservoir in your community makes everything in your life possible.
                        ccess to water sources has a vital role in city development. One of the major advantages of being with us
                        is nearness water . Nearness to water sources to the city is an inexpensive cost to improve infrastructure.</p>

                <h2>Nice Climate</h2>
                <p>The warm climate also makes it very easy for palm trees, aloes, olive, orange and lemon trees to grow. 
                    And of course an abundance of flowering trees, shrubs and bushes like the mimosa, jasmine, roses and 
                    carnations. The main place for orange and lemon trees is between Cannes, Antibes, Monaco and Menton. 
                    The latter in particular being very well known for their citrus production. Many of the cut flowers 
                    that you will find in the flower markets are grown around the Frejus and Antibes areas, however carnations 
                    and roses are mainly grown in Nice and Grasse areas, well known for their 'parfumerie's'.</p>

                <h2>Fishing Possibilities</h2>
                <p>
                    We provide fishing possibilities which creates opportunities of spending time with your family which in turn promotes 
                    feelings of security and well-being, making fishing a worthwhile activity to learn.

                    Vitamin D helps your body regulate the absorption of calcium and phosphorus, two minerals that improve immune system 
                    function and help defend against disease. The best source of vitamin D is a day outdoors under the sun.

                    A beautiful day spent in a mountain stream followed by a dinner of grilled fish. Sounds idyllic doesn't it? Spending 
                    long hours in nature with a focused task is akin to meditation, an activity linked to lowered blood pressure and decreased anxiety.
